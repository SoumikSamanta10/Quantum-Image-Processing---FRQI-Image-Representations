### Quantum Image Processing - FRQI Image Representations
Quantum image representation (QIR) is a necessary part of quantum image processing (QIP) and plays an important role in quantum information processing. Research of QIP is mainly divided into two aspects: quantum image representations and quantum image processing algorithms. Among them, the quantum image representation, as the basis of image processing, specifies the representation of images in a quantum computer. The quantum image representation model plays an important role as the basis of quantum image processing. There have been many research results on quantum image representation models, here I describe a flexible representation for quantum images (FRQI). These quantum image representations encode colour pixels as well as positions in different ways, making them somewhat different in terms of image processing applications and algorithmic complexity.
